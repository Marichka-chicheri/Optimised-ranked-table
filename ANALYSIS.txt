CODE ANALYSIS REPORT
====================

ISSUES FOUND:
-------------

1. setup.py TYPO:
   - Line 4: "descriprion" should be "description"
   - Missing "py_modules" parameter (added in fixed version)

2. PNG FILE MYSTERY:
   - Your script does NOT create any PNG/graph files
   - Your script only creates CSV text output
   - If you're seeing PNG files, they're from a DIFFERENT script
   - Likely from my previous tournament.py that you installed

3. DIFFERENT FILE FORMATS:
   Your script expects:
     Team1,Team2,Score1,Score2
     Barcelona,Real_Madrid,3,1
   
   My script expected:
     TEAMS
     Barcelona
     MATCHES
     Barcelona,Real_Madrid,A


HOW YOUR SCRIPT WORKS:
----------------------

Input file format (matches.csv):
  # Team1,Team2,Score1,Score2
  Barcelona,Real_Madrid,3,1
  Atletico,Sevilla,2,0

Command to run:
  tournament rank matches.csv
  tournament rank matches.csv output.csv

Output:
  - Console: Rankings printed
  - File: CSV with rank,team,pagerank,percentage


WHAT TO DO:
-----------

1. UNINSTALL old version:
   pip uninstall tournament-ranker

2. Install YOUR version:
   pip install .

3. Run YOUR script:
   tournament rank matches.csv

4. Check output:
   - Should see rankings in console
   - NO PNG file (your script doesn't make graphs)


FILES PROVIDED:
---------------

setup.py              - FIXED version (typo corrected, py_modules added)
optimized_ranking_table.py - Your original script (no changes needed)
matches.csv           - Example input file in YOUR format
ANALYSIS.txt          - This file


TO TEST:
--------

1. Open terminal
2. cd to folder with these files
3. pip install .
4. tournament rank matches.csv
5. You should see:
   Tournament ranking:
   1. Barcelona: 0.xxxxx
   2. Real_Madrid: 0.xxxxx
   etc.


CONCLUSION:
-----------

✅ Your script is correctly built for CLI
✅ setup.py works (after fixing typo)
✅ Your script does NOT create PNG files
❌ If you see PNG files, uninstall old version first

The unexpected PNG behavior is from a DIFFERENT script!
